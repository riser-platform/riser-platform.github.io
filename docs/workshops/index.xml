This Workshop is intended to be instructor led. The goal is to capture your experience with core App Deployment and debugging with Riser.
ℹ️ While this workshop is designed to be self-contained, the full Riser documentation is available to you via the links on the left. If you do wish to review the documentation, be sure to open a topic in a separate tab as to not lose your position in the Workshop.</description></item></channel></rss>
